# An Analysis of a Kickstarter Campaign

## Overview of the Project
The play _Fever_ came to a close to its fundraising goal. And now the director wants to analyse different campaigns to compare hers in relation to the other ones, based on dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose
Using the dataset in this repository I used filters, pivot tables and charts to give the director of _Fever_ a clear breakdown of the other campaings and proposed new alternatives.

## Analysis and Challenges

As shown in the previous two images an analysis was made first on a macro perspective to determine the best campaign to raise funds for our project and afterwards based on the date provided establish the best time of the year to execute the campaign.
## Recomendations
I should suggest focusing on theatre for our crowdfunding and focus on launching this campaign during May-June, because normally this correlates to succesful campaigns.
